##Codename: Whistle
Bid Whist card game written in C# using WPF.  Intially the 
[Straight Whist (_also called 52 card Whist_)](http://www.pagat.com/boston/bidwhist.html#52) variation of Bid Whist.  
The classic game of [Whist](http://www.pagat.com/whist/whist.html) which was played widely in the 18th and 19th centuries. Whist was derived from the older game 
_Ruff and Honours_, and in the twentieth century, Bridge has displaced Whist as the most popular card game internationally 
among serious card players. Nevertheless, Whist continues to be played in Britain, often in local tournaments called 
"Whist drives". 
[Bid Whist](http://www.bicyclecards.ca/game-rules/bid-whist/200.php?page_id=32) is a comparatively new game of the Whist family. In certain regions, it has gained a considerable following. 
The original version was invented by Hubert Phillips.  Bid Whist enjoys great popularity in the american military and among
african-americans.

This is a WPF application for the desktop written in C# for the .Net framework 4.0.  I am an avid player of
Bid Whist but I find it quite difficult to find three other interested players to get a game, therefore I have
decided to write my own partner and my own opponent in the form of a computer game.  This is my first attempt 
at any kind of AI and I will likely be using a largely heuristic driven model to design my computer opponents
and partner.

Please feel free to provide any and all **constructive** criticism and feedback.  I can use all of the input that
I can get on the development of the computer players in this application.  Even suggestions of resources would
be welcome.  Thank you.

_Please note that this is a work in progress and should at all times be buildable, but with limited functionality
that will be increasing as I develop the game in my spare time.  I have a full-time job developing software in C#.Net
and am kept quite busy with work projects.  I would however, like to offer a commitment that I will at some point
finish this application.  Likely through a process of slow but consistent feature development._
